===============
cmsplugin-shop
===============

A set of django CMS plugins to expose some of django SHOP's functionality to CMS pages.

This is a work in progress, so don't exxpect anything to work yet :)

Some code was roughly open-sourced, so while it should work, it is still very
ugly and will most likely be renamed.

What you should expect here
===========================

* Code to display an arbitrary list of django-SHOP Product subclasses (admin
  gets to choose which products). Think catalogue.
* A plugin to display the N top selling products
* A plugin to display the contents of the shop's shopping cart.
